"""Objects for data serialization.

Aside from concrete implementations of :class:`.WriterBase`-derived classes for
particular file formats, this module provides a :func:`.writer` factory function that
allows to dynamically retrieve particular writer objects. This function is used by
:class:`.Tesliper` when exporting data to allow for use of user-provided
:class:`.WriterBase` subclasses.

class Parser(ABC):
    """Abstract base class for parsers implemented as finite state machines.

    This base class defines some methods to organize work parsers implemented as
    finite state machines: automates registration of methods and functions
    as parser's states, manages its execution, and registers derived class
    as parser used for certain type of files (which registry is used by Soxhlet
    object).

    The default parsing flow goes as follow:
    1. method 'parse' is called with file handle as argument;
    2. method 'initial' is set as a 'workhorse'
    3. 'workhorse' is called for consecutive lines in file handle
    4. 'initial' checks if any registered trigger matches current line
    5. 'workhorse' is changed to method associated with first matching trigger
    6. calling 'workhorse' on consecutive lines continues
    7. 'parse' returns dictionary with extracted values

    To make this possible, each method marked as state should return dictionary
    (or sequence convertible to dict) and handle changing 'workhorse' to next
    appropriate state. To mark a method as parser's state use Parser.state
    decorator in class definition or add a state directly to parser instance
    using 'add_state' method.

    When subclassing Parser, one should implement 'initial' and 'parse' methods.
    Those abstract methods implement basic functionality, described above. See
    methods' documentation for more details. If you wish not to use default
    Parser's protocol, simply override those methods to your liking.

    To register class derived from Parser for use by Soxhlet object, simply
    set 'purpose' class attribute to name, under which class should be
    registered. Setting it to one of names already defined (e.g. 'gaussian')
    will override the default parser used by Soxhlet object.

    Attributes
    ----------
    states: dict
        dictionary of parser states, created automatically on object
        instantiation from object methods marked as states; method name is used
        as a key by default
    triggers: dict
        dictionary of triggers for parser states, created automatically on
        object instantiation from object methods marked as states with triggers;
        key for a particular state trigger should be the same as state's key in
        self.states dictionary

    Class Attributes
    ----------------
    parsers: dict
        class attribute, which is a registry, implemented as dictionary,
        of classes subclassing Parser and defining 'purpose' class attribute
    purpose: str
        attribute, that helps Soxhlet to identify Parser's subclass purpose

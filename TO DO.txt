CURRENT:
energies extraction from spectra outputs
add graph labels
add graph baseline reversal
correct displaying of checkboxes
impement smart calculation and smart export
bind <<enter>> to entry widgets
add errors prompt/focus on log
prevent spectra recalculating if settings not changed
refresh 'single conformer' list after new data loaded
~~check roa intensity calculations~~
~~check spectra calculations (signals intensity)~~
~~correct text saving precision~~
~~check intensity calculations~~
~~add bars values on single spectra graph~~
~~add gui feedback on session instantiation~~

DESIGN:
conformers tab has visual info for each entry
export directory must be choosen on each export 
~~move conformers information table to front page~~
~~start new session -> clear session~~
~~one-click extract data from destination~~
~~separate visual for what is available~~
~~number of selected items in conformers tab~~
~~remove work/output dir information~~
CANCELED separate manual extraction window (popup)
CANCELED show conformers with no energies in conformers tab

SOON:
add finding optimal spectra range
switch to installable version
handle uncompatible Gaussian versions
add jaguar support
add drag&drop support
export from spectra tab
export spectra as image
move filtering functions to tesliper.py
suplement docstrings
add some code commentary
create testing suite
spectra colour by population
supplement info tab
add icon
solve silent data overriding problem

FUTURE:
add tooltips
add spectra comparition feature
add velo and lenght electronic spectra comparition
add anharmonic spectra support
add nmr spectra
add geometry analysis feature
add molecule dispay window ?
~~add easy access to conformer data~~
~~manage e-m angle and energy corrections~~
